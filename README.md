# Food Vision

In this project. I've created a feature extraction model for food101 and then fine tuned the model which improved the accuracy from 70% to 80% for EfficientNetB0 and 68% to 82% for EfficientNetB4.

## About Dataset
The dataset used here is from [Food101](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101) which is avaiable on tensorflow datasets.

## About files
* helper_functions.py contains helper functions used in the main notebook
* food_vision_EfficientNetB0 is a jupyter notebook in which the EfficientNetB0 model is used for feature extraction and fine tuning.
* food_vision_EfficientNetB4 is a jupyter notebook in which the EfficientNetB4 model is used for feature extraction and fine tuning.
* zip file is a saved fine tuning model for EfficientNetB0.
* zip file for EfficientNetB4 was not uploaded because of the size.
